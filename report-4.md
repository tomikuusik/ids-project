#Planning your project
### Tasks:
1. Making the used data more readable (currently the stock market data is currently contained within separate .txt files which should be made more readable by first transferring the data to .csv files and then compacting the files to one dataset)
   - Python and pandas to read in the data and compact it into one file/dataframe
2. Cleaning up the data (keep only the data from years 2015 and 2016 as thatâ€™s the only time where we have both the stock market data and the world news data)
   - Python (pandas) data cleaning tools
3. Determining the best way to find a correlation between keywords in r/worldnews headlines and US stock market price changes.
4. Applying the methods
   - sklearn will be of help here
5. Analysis and conclusions
   - Looking at the results and drawing conclusions based on those:
     Did we manage to achieve our initial business and data mining goals
